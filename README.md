# Pysnake
 PySnake is an implementation of the classic Snake game, developed in Python using the curses, random, and time libraries. The game is designed to run in the terminal, with movement controlled through the arrow keys and the ability to adjust difficulty based on the player's selection.  Key Features:  Controlled Movement: The player can control the snake's direction using the arrow keys. If no key is pressed, the direction remains the same, allowing continuous movement. Difficulty Selection: The game offers different difficulty levels, adjusting the time interval between movements based on the player's choice. Collision Detection: The game ends when the snake's head collides with the edges of the playing field, using the curses library to detect the terminal window's boundaries. Simple and Functional Design: The snake is represented by special characters, such as @ for the head and diamonds for the body, while the game field is enclosed by a border, providing clear and straightforward visualization. Technologies Used:  curses: For terminal interface manipulation, capturing keyboard input, and displaying game elements. random: For generating random events, such as food items (♥) that enlarge the snake. time: For controlling the game’s pace, adjusting the movement speed according to the selected difficulty. Project Objective: This project was developed to apply fundamental programming concepts, such as flow control, data manipulation using lists and dictionaries, and real-time user interaction. It also serves as a demonstration of Python skills and terminal interface manipulation, which are valuable in automation projects, simple games, and interactive applications.  Potential Improvements:  Add functionality to save and display the highest score. Include new game modes, such as infinite levels or multiplayer.
